           Ilm al-jabr wa'l-muḳābala by the Persian mathematician and astronomer al-Khwarizmi. The word entered the English language during the
           fifteenth century, from either Spanish, Italian, or Medieval Latin. It originally referred to the surgical procedure of setting broken
           or dislocated bones. The mathematical meaning was first recorded in the sixteenth century.</font></td>

      <p> <font size="5">As a single word without an article, "algebra" names a broad part of mathematics.
As a single word with an article or in plural, "an algebra" or "algebras" denotes a specific mathematical structure, whose precise definition
depends on the author. Usually, the structure has an addition, multiplication, and a scalar multiplication (see Algebra over a field). When
some authors use the term "algebra", they make a subset of the following additional assumptions: associative, commutative, unital, and/or
finite-dimensional. In universal algebra, the word "algebra" refers to a generalization of the above concept, which allows for n-ary
operations.</font></p>
