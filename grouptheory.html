      <p><font size=5> <pre>  </pre>  Group theory is the study of groups. Groups are sets equipped with an operation (like multiplication, addition, or composition) that satisfies certain basic properties. As the building blocks of abstract algebra, groups are so general and fundamental that they arise in nearly every branch of mathematics and the sciences. For example:



Symmetry groups appear in the study of combinatorics overview and algebraic number theory, as well as physics and chemistry. For example, Burnside's lemma can be used to count combinatorial objects associated with symmetry groups.
4
has tetrahedral shape; its symmetry group has 24 elements. Chemists use symmetry groups to classify molecules and predict many of their chemical properties.

Elliptic curve groups are studied in algebraic geometry and number theory, and are widely used in modern cryptography.</font></p>
