  <pre>        <font size="6" color="black">What is Mathematics ?</font></pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement.</font> </pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">Math is all around us, in everything we do</font> </pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices,
     architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering, and even sports.</font> </pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematic discovery has been at the forefront of every</font> </pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">civilized society, and in use in even the most primitive of cultures. The needs of math arose based</font> </pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">on the wants of society. The more complex a society, the more complex the mathematical needs.</font> </pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">Primitive tribes needed little more than the ability to count, but also relied on math to</font> </pre>
  <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">calculate the position of the sun and the physics of hunting.</font> </pre>

  <pre>        <font size="6" color="black">History of mathematics</font></pre>
  <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">Several civilizations — in China, India, Egypt, Central America and Mesopotamia — contributed </font> </pre>
  <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">to mathematics as we know it today. The Sumerians were the first people to develop </font> </pre>

  <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">were the first people to develop a counting system. Mathematicians developed arithmetic,</font> </pre>
  <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey"> which includes basic operations, multiplication, fractions and square roots. The Sumerians’</font> </pre>
  <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">system passed through the Akkadian Empire to the Babylonians around 300 B.C. Six hundred</font> </pre>
  <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">years later, in America, the Mayans developed elaborate calendar systems and were </font> </pre>
  <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">skilled astronomers. About this time, the concept ofzero was developed.
        <pre>       <font size="5" color="grey">According to one pure mathematician, pure mathematicians prove theorems, and applied mathematicians
        <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">construct theories. Pure and applied are not mutually exclusive, but they are rooted in
        <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">different areas of math and problem solving. Though the complex math involved in pure and
        <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">applied mathematics is beyond the understanding of most average Americans, the solutions
        <pre>        <font size="5" color="grey">developed from the processes have affected and improved the lives of all.</font> </pre>
